# Networks with associated IP prefixes

List of networks and their associated IP prefixes. Instead of common
geolocation based on IP addresses, this data collection aims to map IP
addresses to networks based on their legal entities. This makes it e.g.
possible to allow, restrict or block IP prefixes of a specific network
in a packet filter, firewall or other software.
